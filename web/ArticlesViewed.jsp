			<h2>Bloomberg takes a beating, Sanders defends socialism in fiery debate</h2>
			(by Marc Caputo, NOlan D. McCaskill and Jesse Naranjo, Politico) — Democrats came out hot in Las Vegas on Wednesday with a new target onstage: Mike Bloomberg.

For the first time since his late entry into the race and after a $400 million ad campaign, Bloomberg faced five other Democrats eager to take him down in an unscripted environment.

But Bloomberg wasn’t the only one to draw fire. Bernie Sanders, the primary’s new frontrunner, faced questions on his health care plan and his refusal to release medical records after his heart attack.

Wednesday’s debate is the last before Saturday’s Nevada caucuses.

Here are some of the night’s biggest moments [from the reporters’  and editor’s point of view].

		<h2>Education Department Investigating Harvard, Yale Over Foreign Funding</h2>
		(by Kate O’Keeffe, The Wall Street Journal) — The U.S. Department of Education opened investigations into Harvard and Yale as part of a continuing review that it says has found U.S. universities failed to report at least $6.5 billion in foreign funding from countries such as China and Saudi Arabia, according to department materials viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The investigations into the Ivy League schools are the latest in a clash between U.S. universities and a coalition of federal officials including law enforcement, research funders such as the National Institutes of Health, and a bipartisan group in Congress that has raised concerns about higher-education institutions’ reliance on foreign money, particularly from China.

	<h2>DOJ to investigate if sanctuary cities are breaking the law</h2>
		
		(by Ben Feuerherd, New York Post) — Attorney General William Barr said Monday that the Justice Department will review the policies of sanctuary cities to determine if they’re a breaking federal law that prohibits the “harboring or shielding of aliens in the United States.”

Speaking to the National Sheriffs’ Association, Barr pointed to a recent case in New York in which an undocumented man raped and killed a 92-year-old woman in Queens to argue progressive politicians put “the interests of criminal aliens before those of law-abiding citizens.”

“When we are talking about sanctuary cities, we’re talking about policies that are designed to allow criminal aliens to escape,” Barr said.

“These policies are not about people who came to our country illegally, but have otherwise been peaceful and productive members of society. The express purpose of these policies is to shelter aliens whom local law enforcement have already arrested for crimes,” he added.

He then accused sanctuary jurisdictions such as New York of violating federal law because their law-enforcement agencies do not share information about “criminal aliens” and prevent federal immigration authorities from taking them into custody.

   <h2>George Washington, Father of our Country</h2>
   In 2012, George Washington’s personal copy of the Constitution, in which he had written notes, sold at auction for $9.8 million.
The Mt. Vernon Ladies Association bought it.
It allowed us to see, for the first time, how cautiously our first president assumed the office, his eyes not toward history but the future.
Next to two passages explicating the signing of a bill into law, which he bracketed, Washington has written in cursive, “President.”
He also inscribed “Presidential Powers” next to the paragraphs that lay out the president’s role as commander-in-chief, as well as his authority to grant pardons, make treaties and appoint Supreme Court justices.
Beneath that, in the paragraph that reads, “He shall from time to time give Congress information of the state of the union,” Washington has added “required,” and it was he who established the address as an annual event.

   <h2>DHS suspends Global Entry program for New Yorkers following sanctuary law</h2>
   (by Elizabeth Rosner, New York Post and Michelle Hackman, WSJ) — The Department of Homeland Security announced the suspension of renewals and enrollments for Global Entry and other Trusted Travel Programs for New York residents.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Wednesday that the move was a response to the state’s “Green Light Law” for illegal immigrants.

“Today, we sent a letter to New York indicating, because they took these measures, that New York residents are no longer eligible to enroll in these Trusted Traveler Programs,” Wolf said.

Other programs suspended by DHS include NEXUS, SENTRI and FAST. They have millions of members and allow them to bypass long Customs and Border Protection lines.

The change will also prohibit vehicle exports. The letter does not refer to TSA’s PreCheck program.

“Although DHS would prefer to continue our long-standing cooperative relationship with New York on a variety of these critical homeland security initiatives, this Act and the corresponding lack of security cooperation from the New York DMV requires DHS to take immediate action to ensure DHS’s efforts to protect the Homeland are not compromised,” Wolf wrote in a letter sent to New York state officials.

The Green Light Law, enacted in December 2019, allows illegal immigrants in New York to apply for New York driver licenses [using foreign documents, including passports, to obtain licenses] while preventing ICE access to information on these individuals.

According to Wolf, the Green Light Law prohibits the state DMV from sharing criminal records with Customs and Border Protection and with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Wolf said the change would go into immediate effect.

The change comes a day after President Trump’s State of the Union address, in which he attacked “sanctuary cities,” including New York City, for protecting illegal immigrants [as the law interferes with the prosecution and/or deportation of criminal illegal aliens].

   <h2>Education Department Investigating Harvard, Yale Over Foreign Funding</h2>
   (by Kate O’Keeffe, The Wall Street Journal) — The U.S. Department of Education opened investigations into Harvard and Yale as part of a continuing review that it says has found U.S. universities failed to report at least $6.5 billion in foreign funding from countries such as China and Saudi Arabia, according to department materials viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The investigations into the Ivy League schools are the latest in a clash between U.S. universities and a coalition of federal officials including law enforcement, research funders such as the National Institutes of Health, and a bipartisan group in Congress that has raised concerns about higher-education institutions’ reliance on foreign money, particularly from China.

… The Education Department described higher-education institutions in the U.S., in a document viewed by the Journal, as:

“multi-billion dollar, multi-national enterprises using opaque foundations, foreign campuses, and other sophisticated legal structures to generate revenue”

… Universities are required to disclose to the Education Department all contracts and gifts from a foreign source that, alone or combined, are worth $250,000 or more in a calendar year. Though the statute is decades old, the department only recently began to vigorously enforce it [under the Trump administration].

Officials accused schools of actively soliciting money from foreign governments, companies and nationals known to be hostile to the U.S. [who are] potentially in search of opportunities to steal research and “spread propaganda benefitting foreign governments,” according to the document.

In addition, while the department said it has found foreign money generally flows to the country’s richest universities, “such money apparently does not reduce or otherwise offset American students’ tuition costs,” the document said.

U.S. officials say China uses a variety of means to target academia, including government-funded talent recruitment programs such as the Thousand Talents Plan. The arrest last month of Dr. Charles Lieber, 60, the chairman of Harvard’s chemistry department on federal charges of lying about receiving millions of dollars in Chinese funding through the program while the U.S. shelled out more than $15 million to fund his research group catapulted the issue into the spotlight.
